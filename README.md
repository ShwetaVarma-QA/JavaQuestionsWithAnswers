# JavaProgram
I will be adding solutions to java programming questions. If you want to get solution to any of the Java programming questions, please reach out to me.

Following are the questions, for which you can find solution in the code

## Added solutions for following Java problem statements

#### DuplicateCharCounter
Display the alphabet along with the number of times it is repeated in a String.
  - for ex. If we have a String "Shweta Varma", the outcome should be "a=3".

#### BalancedStringSolution

#### BiggestPalindromeString.java
#### CodilityDemoSolution

This is a demo task.
Write a function:
class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }
that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.
For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
[1,2,3,4,6]
Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.
Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].
{-1, -3, -8}


#### ReverseTheString

Reverse the string by maintaining the space at it's place, e.g. 'I am Shweta' is 'A TE whsmai'
